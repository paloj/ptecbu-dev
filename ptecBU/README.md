# ptecBU Codebase Overview (autogenerated by GPT4Readability)

Welcome to the ptecBU codebase! This repository contains a Windows-based application developed in C#. The application is designed to run on Windows 7.0, as indicated by the `System.Runtime.Versioning.TargetPlatformAttribute` and `System.Runtime.Versioning.SupportedOSPlatformAttribute`.

## :rocket: Purpose and Functionalities

The ptecBU application serves as a utility tool with the following main functionalities:

1. **Tray Icon Accessibility**: The application includes a tray icon that is accessible throughout the program class.
2. **Destination Reachability**: The application checks if a certain destination is reachable.
3. **Argument Handling**: The application can be started with arguments, which will disable tray icon actions.
4. **Delay Functionality**: The application supports a "-delay" argument that causes the program to pause for 40 seconds.

## :wrench: Installation

As this is a Windows-based application, it is expected to be distributed as an executable file (.exe). To install it, you would typically download the .exe file and run it on your Windows 7.0 system.

## :package: Dependencies

The application relies on several .NET libraries, including:

- System
- System.IO
- System.Drawing
- System.Linq
- System.Windows.Forms

These libraries are part of the .NET framework and should be available on any Windows system.

## :computer: Usage

To run the application with a delay, you can use the "-delay" argument. For example:

```bash
ptecBU.exe -delay
```

This will start the application and then pause it for 40 seconds.

## :busts_in_silhouette: Authors or Maintainers
